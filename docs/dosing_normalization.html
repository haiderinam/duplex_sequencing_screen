Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/haiderinam/duplex_sequencing_screen/tree/d6a6fd23a1f65cedd71238156e8482869aa7bcf1" target="_blank">d6a6fd2</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<p>Varying growth rates based on density Not exactly sure if it should be a density-dependent variation or if it should be dependent on the presence/absence of other variants. Maybe it’s wiser to make a function Input: number of mutants, name of mutants, growth rate of mutants, starting frequency of mutants, dosage time Output: dataframe of mutant numbers over time</p>
<p>Principled approach that can detect if the dose is off</p>

<pre class="r"><code>#You&#39;re able to reduce replicate to replicate heterogeneity, but does that improve how well your observed values match your IC50 predictions? Answer: not really. But because the replicate to replicate agreement is so high, it points to the fact that your IC50 predictions are potentially off!

<p>What if you used the actual hill coefficients of the mutants rather than E255K’s hill coefficient (2.83). Would the correlation improve? Would the simulations decrease in quality if you altered the E255K growth rates and tried to make corrections off of those? This is kind of like a negative control for corrections.</p>
