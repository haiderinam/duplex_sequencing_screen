The flow cytometry data was downloaded for regions 1,2,3, and 4 via benchling on 8/11/2024.
The flow cytometry data for each region measures the overall population density as well as the resistant mutant populations
The resistant mutants, T315I and mCherry, were spiked-in at allele frequencies of 1 in 500.
T315I was used in regions 1 3, and 4. F359V was used for region 2.

The screen for region 1 (ABL residues 242 through 322) was conducted on 2.14.2023
