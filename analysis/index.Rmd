* ###Click [here](dose_response_curve_fitting.html) for the script that reads BCRABL dose response data, and fits it to a 4-parameter dose response curve.

* ###Click [here](twinstrand_spikeins_data_generation.html) for the script that reads mutation annotation data and generates dataframes with annotated variants and the correct cell counts  

* ###Click [here](growthrate_plots.html) for initial growth rate plots  
<img src="assets/growthrates.png" width="400" height="300"  alt="">  

* ###Click [here](growthrate_plots_ENU.html) for growth rate plots for ENU mutants  
<img src="assets/growthrates_ENU.png" width="400" height="300"  alt="">  

* ###Click [here](spikeins_depthofcoverages.html) for analysis looking at whether we achieved our desired depth of coverages
<img src="assets/coverages.png" width="400" height="300"  alt="">  

* ###Click [here](clinical_abundance_predictions.html) for analysis looking at how well our data predicts BCRABL clinical abundance compared to conventional IC50s
<img src="assets/clinical_abundance_predictions.png" width="600" height="400"  alt="">  

* ###Click [here](misc.html) for method to obtain confidence intervals on growth rates from IC50 measurements. Plotted alongside observed growth rate data, these confidence intervals show how well our pooled data matches predictions based off of IC50s. (Needs updates in methodology)

* ###Click [here](4_7_20_update.html) for analyses of replicate to replicate agreement between the spike in replicates. Also includes this analysis for the mutagenesis replicates. Also includes the agreement in observed vs predicted depth of coverages for all sequencing pools. Note: this analysis does not include dosage corrections that improves replicate to replicate heterogeneity.

What is in each directory:  
  
* __Data__: contains data downloaded prior to analyses.  
* __Output__: contains data that the code makes  
* __Analysis__: contains your Rmarkdown files with the code.  
* __Docs__: contain the html output from the Rmd files in the analysis directory.  
* __Code__: contains .R files that are functions that the Rmd files in the analysis folder use.
