* Click [here](ABL_Region1_parser.html) to view the region 1 data parsing code on the CRISPR cut SM libraries. Code also contains solvent accessibility analyses on DMS data. 


* Click [here](ABL_region234_parser.html) to view imatinib resistance heatmap and look at analyses of replicate correlations in our DMS screens.

* Click [here](regions1234_spikeins_growthrates.html) to view growth rates from mCherry-tagged mutant standards that were spiked-in with the DMS library in our functional screens. The growth rates from these mutants help us normalize the screen for dose-response.  

* Click [here](ABL_cosmic_analysis_fullkinase.html) to view our analyses of imatinib resistance in the full ABL kinase. This includes heatmaps, scatterplots, boxplots, waterfall plots, all analyzing the imatinib resistance profile of the ABL kinase.
